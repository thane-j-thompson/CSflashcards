        "Question": "Q)  What are the differences between an API Controller and a \"regular/view\" Controller in.NET?\r",
        "Answer": "A)  An API Controller is specialized for exposing data and functionality through web APIs whereas regular controllers are used for generating HTML views and handling user interactions in traditional web applications.\r"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q)  When creating a new controller, what class do you inherit from?\r",
        "Answer": "A)  You inherit from the class that provides the necessary functionality for handling HTTP requests and managing the controller actions.  A Regular (View) Controller would inherit from the Controller class. An API Controller would inherit from ControllerBase. In ASP.NET Core, you can create controllers that serve both regular views and API endpoints by inheriting from ControllerBase class. This provides a unified controller structure for handling both webpages and API requests. \r"

        "Question": "Q)  What are Interfaces?\r",
        "Answer": "A)  An interface is a fundamental concept in OOP that defines a contract or set of abstract methods and properties that a class must implement.  For instance, what signature appears in ILogger.cs must be implemented is the Logger.cs class.\r"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q)  What is an abstract class and is this different than an interface?\r",
        "Answer": "A)  Ab abstract class and an interface are both OOP concepts but serve different purposes.  An abstract class serves as a blue print for other classes.  An interface defines a contract that classess must adhere with regard to the methods, properties, events, or indexes that implementing class must provide.  \r"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q)  Can you create an instance of an abstract class?\r",

React.memo is similar to React.PureComponent but for function components instead of classes.\r"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What is a Contstructor in React?\r",
        "Answer": "A) A constructor is a special method that is called when a class is instantiated.  It is used to initialize the class's properties and bind class methods.  In React, the constructor is used for two purposes:  Initializing the local state by assigning an object to this.state, and Binding event handler methods to an instance.\r"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What is JSX?\r",
        "Answer": "A) JSX is JavaScript XML.  It is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like syntax in JavaScript and is transformed into valid HTML by Babel.

        "Question": "Q) What is the Singleton and was are the drawbacks?\r",
        "Answer": "A) Singleton is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.  The singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.  Drawbacks are:  Global state, tight coupling, and concurrency.\r"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What is dependency injection?\r",
        "Answer": "A) Dependency injection is a technique whereby one object (or static method) supplies the dependencies of another object. A dependency is an object that can be used (a service). An injection is the passing of a dependency to a dependent object (a client) that would use it. The service is made part of the client's state. Passing the service to the client, rather than allowing a client to build or find the service, is the fundamental requirement of the pattern.\r"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What is a Model View Controller?\r",
        "Answer": "A) Model�view�controller (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user. The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for efficient code reuse and parallel development.\r"

        "Answer": "A) An arrow function in React is a concise way to define functions. It's often used for defining event handlers and functional components. Arrow functions have a lexical this, making them convenient for accessing the component's context and state. \r"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) Differentiate between stateful and stateless components. Stateful vs Stateless Components React\r",
        "Answer": "A) Stateful components (also known as class components) in React can manage and update their own state data using the setState method. They have a render method and can hold and modify data over time. Stateless components (also known as functional components) do not manage state. They receive data (props) as input and return JSX elements based on that data. They are purely presentational and do not have their own state management logic.\r"
    },

Developers can use them in React components to handle user interactions like clicks, key presses, and form submissions.\r"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What is a ref in React?\r",
        "Answer": "A) A ref in React is a way to access and interact with a DOM element or a React component directly. It allows you to reference elements and components and is often used for tasks like focusing input fields, triggering animations, or reading values from the DOM.\r"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) List some of the cases when you should use Refs.\r",
        "Answer": "A) You should use refs in React when you need to: (1) Access DOM elements directly.  (2) Trigger imperative animations or actions.  (3) Integrate with third-party libraries that require direct DOM manipulation.  (4) Manage focus, such as focusing on input fields.  (5) Measure the size or position of an element.  (6) Implement custom logic or interactions that can't be achieved with state or props alone.\r"

Then, import and use these components wherever needed in your application, promoting code reusability and maintainability.\r"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) How are forms created in React?\r",
        "Answer": "A) Forms in React are created using HTML form elements like `form`, `input`, `textarea`, and `button`, and you manage form data using React state. Event handlers like `onChange` are used to capture and handle user input, updating the component's state accordingly.\r"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What do you know about controlled and uncontrolled components?\r",
        "Answer": "A) Controlled components in React are form elements whose values are controlled by React state. Their values are set and updated through state, and changes are handled via event handlers.  Uncontrolled components are form elements where the DOM element itself holds the state, not React. You typically use refs to access their values when needed. Controlled components offer more control and are recommended for most use cases, while uncontrolled components may be useful in certain situations where you want to integrate with non-React code or manage state externally.\r"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What is Higher OrderComponents(HOC)?\r",
        "Answer": "A) A Higher Order Component (HOC) in React is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props, behavior, or functionality. HOCs are used for code reuse, cross-cutting concerns like authentication or logging, and enhancing components without modifying their original code.\r"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What can you do with HOC?\r",
        "Answer": "A) With Higher Order Components (HOCs) in React, you can:  (1) Reuse component logic across multiple components.  (2) Add or modify props, behavior, or state to components. (3) Implement cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, or routing. (4) Encapsulate and enhance component functionality without altering the original component code.

    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) How is React Router different from conventional routing?\r",
        "Answer": "A) React Router is different from conventional routing in web development because it enables client-side routing within a single-page application (SPA) without full page reloads. Conventional routing typically involves server-side routing, where each route corresponds to a separate server request, resulting in full page refreshes. React Router, on the other hand, handles routing on the client side, providing a smoother and more interactive user experience within a single HTML page.\r"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What is React.memo ?\r",
        "Answer": "A) `React.memo` is a higher-order component (HOC) that is used for optimizing functional components. It memoizes, or caches, the result of a component's rendering so that it only re-renders when its props change. This can help improve performance by preventing unnecessary renders of a component when its inputs remain the same.\r"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What is the difference between calling a promise and using a '.then' vs using 'await'\r",
        "Answer": "A) The difference between calling a promise using `.then` and using `await` is in how you handle asynchronous operations:  (1) `.then`: It involves chaining `.then` methods to handle the result or error of a promise sequentially. This is more callback-style and can lead to \"callback hell\" with deeply nested code.  (2) `await`: It's used inside an `async` function to pause execution until the promise is resolved. It provides a more linear and readable code structure, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations.  Using `await` often leads to cleaner and more maintainable asynchronous code.\r"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What are required properties of the object in your package.json file?\r",
        "Answer": "A) In a `package.json` file, the only required property is `\"name\"`. This property specifies the name of the package or project. Other properties like `\"version\"` and `\"dependencies\"` are commonly included but not strictly required.\r"

    {
        "Question": "Q) What is NPM/Yarn?\r",
        "Answer": "A) NPM (Node Package Manager) and Yarn are package managers for JavaScript and Node.js. They are used to install, manage, and share packages (libraries and modules) of code from the Node Package Registry (NPM) or other sources. These packages can be dependencies for web and Node.js applications, making it easier to manage project dependencies and streamline the development process.\r"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) Can different versions of the same package be used in the same application?\r",
        "Answer": "A) Yes, different versions of the same package can be used in the same application. This is possible due to the concept of \"dependency resolution\" in package managers like NPM and Yarn. Each package can have its own specific version, and the package manager handles the resolution and isolation of dependencies, ensuring that they do not interfere with each other.\r"

        "Question": "Q) In package.json, how can you ensure that only patch version updates are accepted when npm install is run? (i.e. upgrading from 2.3.0 to 2.3.1 is okay, but not 2.4.0 or greater)\r",
        "Answer": "A) To ensure that only patch version updates are accepted when running `npm install`, you can specify a dependency with a tilde (`~`) in your `package.json` file. This tells npm to only allow updates that are backward-compatible (i.e., it allows patch updates but not minor or major updates). So, upgrading from 2.3.0 to 2.3.1 is allowed, but upgrading to 2.4.0 or greater would require changing the tilde to a caret (`^`) if you want to allow minor updates as well.\r"

        "Question": "Q) How come when you declare a variable in any js or jsx file outside of any class, object, or function, it’s not really global to all other files, components?\r",
        "Answer": "A) In JavaScript or JSX files, when you declare a variable outside of any class, object, or function, it becomes part of the global scope only for that specific file. It is not automatically accessible in other files or components because JavaScript uses a module system that encapsulates variables within the scope of the module (file). To make a variable accessible across multiple files or components, you typically export and import it explicitly using the module system.\r"

        "Answer": "A) The different flavors of for statement in JavaScript are: \r\n1. for loop: Used for iterating over a sequence (like an array) with a counter variable.\r\n2. for...in loop: Used for iterating over the properties of an object.\r\n3. for...of loop: Used for iterating over iterable objects (like arrays, strings, etc.)"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) In JavaScript, why should we declare variables with let or const, not var\r",
        "Answer": "A) We should declare variables with let or const, not var, because let and const have block scope, which helps to avoid issues with variable hoisting and re-declaration that can occur with var."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) In JavaScript, why should we use strict mode.\r",
        "Answer": "A) We should use strict mode in JavaScript to enforce stricter parsing and error handling on our JavaScript code. It helps to catch common coding mistakes and \"use strict\"; at the beginning of a script or function to enable strict mode."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) In JavaScript, what are the types and why should we avoid automatic type conversion.\r",
        "Answer": "A) In JavaScript, there are several data types, including: \r\n1. Primitive types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol\r\n2. Reference types: object, array, function\r\nWe should avoid automatic type conversion because it can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs. JavaScript performs type coercion, which means it automatically converts values to different types when evaluating expressions. This can result in false positives or negatives in conditional statements."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) In JavaScript, Understand prototypes, but use modern syntax for classes, constructors, and methods.\r",
        "Answer": "A) In JavaScript, prototypes are a fundamental concept that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. However, with the introduction of ES6, we now have a more modern and cleaner syntax for creating classes and constructors using the class keyword. This syntax makes it easier to define and work with objects and their methods, while still leveraging the power of prototypes under the hood."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) In JavaScript, why don't we use 'this' outside constructors or methods?\r",
        "Answer": "A) Using 'this' outside of constructors or methods in JavaScript can lead to confusion and unexpected behavior. The value of 'this' is determined by the context in which a function is called, and outside of a method or constructor, it may not refer to the expected object. Therefore, it's best to avoid using 'this' in such contexts to prevent potential bugs and maintain clarity in your code."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What are higher-order functions?\r",
        "Answer": "A) Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. They allow for more abstract and flexible code, enabling patterns like callbacks, function composition, and currying."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What are function expressions?\r",
        "Answer": "A) Function expressions are a way to define functions in JavaScript by assigning them to variables. Unlike function declarations, which are hoisted, function expressions are not hoisted and can only be called after they are defined. They can be anonymous or named and are often used as arguments to higher-order functions."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What are the two ways of defining anonymous functions?\r",
        "Answer": "A) The two ways of defining anonymous functions in JavaScript are:\r\n1. Function expressions: These are defined by assigning a function to a variable, and they can be anonymous or named.\r\n2. Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE): These are functions that are defined and executed immediately after their creation, and they are always anonymous."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What are closures and how do we define them?\r",
        "Answer": "A) Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allow a function to access variables from its outer (enclosing) scope, even after that scope has finished executing. We define a closure by creating a function inside another function and returning the inner function. This way, the inner function retains access to the outer function's variables."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) How to create objects with state and behavior?\r",
        "Answer": "A) In JavaScript, we can create objects with state and behavior using constructor functions or classes. A constructor function is a regular function that is used to create objects. It typically initializes the object's properties (state) and can define methods (behavior) that operate on that state. With the introduction of ES6, we can also use the class syntax to create objects. Classes provide a more concise and clear way to define objects with state and behavior, using the constructor method for initialization and class methods for behavior."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) How does JavaScript use prototypes to support objects without classes?\r",
        "Answer": "A) JavaScript uses prototypes to enable inheritance and shared behavior among objects without the need for classes. Every JavaScript object has a prototype, which is another object from which it can inherit properties and methods. When a property or method is not found on an object, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain until it finds it or reaches the end of the chain. This allows for a flexible and dynamic way to create objects with shared behavior."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What are the features provided by modern JavaScript to define classes and subclasses?\r",
        "Answer": "A) Modern JavaScript (ES6 and later) provides several features to define classes and subclasses, including:\r\n1. Class Syntax: A more concise and clear way to define classes using the `class` keyword.\r\n2. Constructor Method: A special method for initializing new objects created from a class.\r\n3. Inheritance: The ability to create subclasses that inherit properties and methods from a parent class using the `extends` keyword.\r\n4. Super Calls: The `super` keyword allows subclasses to call methods from their parent class.\r\n5. Static Methods: Methods defined on the class itself rather than on instances of the class, using the `static` keyword."

        "Question": "Q) What is object destructuring and what is the syntax to use it?\r",
        "Answer": "A) Object destructuring is a syntax feature in JavaScript that allows you to extract properties from objects and assign them to variables in a more concise way. The syntax involves using curly braces `{}` to specify the properties you want to extract. For example:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst person = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };\r\nconst { name, age } = person;\r\n```"
   },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What is array destructuring and what is the syntax to use it?\r",
        "Answer": "A) Array destructuring is a syntax feature in JavaScript that allows you to extract elements from arrays and assign them to variables in a more concise way. The syntax involves using square brackets `[]` to specify the elements you want to extract. For example:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\r\nconst [first, second] = numbers;\r\n```"
   },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What are exceptions and how should we use them in our programs?\r",
        "Answer": "A) Exceptions are unexpected events that occur during the execution of a program, disrupting its normal flow. In JavaScript, we use `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks to handle exceptions gracefully. The `try` block contains code that may throw an error, the `catch` block handles the error if it occurs, and the `finally` block executes code after the `try` and `catch` blocks, regardless of whether an error occurred. This allows us to manage errors effectively and maintain a smooth user experience."

    {
        "Question": "Q) Why is the concept of modules useful?\r",
        "Answer": "A) The concept of modules is useful because it helps organize code into separate, reusable components, making it easier to manage and maintain. Modules allow developers to encapsulate functionality, expose only what is necessary, and avoid polluting the global namespace. This leads to better code organization, improved collaboration among developers, and easier testing and debugging."

    {
        "Question": "Q) How do we export features from ES modules?\r",
        "Answer": "A) In ES modules, we can export features using the `export` keyword. There are two main ways to export features:\r\n1. Named Exports: We can export multiple features by name. For example:\r\n```javascript\r\n// module.js\r\nexport const pi = 3.14;\r\nexport function add(x, y) {\r\n    return x + y;\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n2. Default Exports: We can export a single feature as the default export. For example:\r\n```javascript\r\n// module.js\r\nconst pi = 3.14;\r\nfunction add(x, y) {\r\n    return x + y;\r\n}\r\nexport default { pi, add };\r\n```"
   },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What is meant by named exports and what are default exports in ES modules?\r",
        "Answer": "A) Named exports allow you to export multiple variables, functions, or classes from a module by their names. They are imported using the same names in the importing module. For example:\r\n```javascript\r\n// module.js\r\nexport const pi = 3.14;\r\nexport function add(x, y) {\r\n    return x + y;\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nDefault exports allow you to export a single variable, function, or class as the default export of a module. It can be imported with any name in the importing module. For example:\r\n```javascript\r\n// module.js\r\nconst pi = 3.14;\r\nfunction add(x, y) {\r\n    return x + y;\r\n}\r\nexport default { pi, add };\r\n```"
   },
    {
        "Question": "Q) How can we import and use the features exported by other modules?\r",
        "Answer": "A) We can import and use features exported by other modules using the `import` keyword. The syntax for importing named exports is as follows:\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { pi, add } from './module.js';\r\n``` \r\nFor default exports, we can use any name for the imported feature:\r\n```javascript\r\nimport myModule from './module.js';\r\n``` \r\nOnce imported, we can use the features in our code."
   },
    {
        "Question": "Q) What is the use of the require function when using CommonJS modules?\r",
        "Answer": "A) The `require` function is used to import modules in CommonJS. It allows you to include and use functionality from other modules by specifying the module's path. For example:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst myModule = require('./myModule.js');\r\n``` \r\nThis will import the exported features from `myModule.js` and make them available in the current module."
